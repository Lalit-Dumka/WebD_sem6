# HTML Elements Notes

## 1. `iframe`

**Description:**
The `<iframe>` element is used to embed another HTML document within the current document. It stands for inline frame and allows for the inclusion of external content such as web pages, videos, and interactive maps.

**Example:**

```html
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="600" height="400" title="Example Website"></iframe>
```

This example embeds the webpage at "<https://www.example.com>" within an iframe that is 600 pixels wide and 400 pixels tall.

## 2. `textarea`

**Description:**
The `<textarea>` element is used to create a multi-line text input field. It is commonly used in forms where the user needs to enter a block of text, such as comments or descriptions.

**Example:**

```html
<textarea name="comments" rows="5" cols="50" placeholder="Enter your comments here..."></textarea>
```

This example creates a textarea with 5 rows and 50 columns, and a placeholder text prompting the user to enter their comments.

## 3. `meta`

**Description:**
The `<meta>` element provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but it is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

**Example:**

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

These examples set the character encoding to UTF-8, describe the content, provide keywords for search engines, name the author of the document, and set the viewport to ensure the page is responsive.

## 4. `input type="radio"`

**Description:**
The `radio` input type is used for radio buttons, which allow the user to select one option from a set of predefined choices. All radio buttons with the same `name` attribute are considered a group, and only one can be selected within that group.

**Example:**

```html
<form>
  <p>Select your gender:</p>
  <input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male">
  <label for="male">Male</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="female" name="gender" value="female">
  <label for="female">Female</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="other" name="gender" value="other">
  <label for="other">Other</label>
</form>
```

This example creates a form with three radio buttons for selecting gender. Only one of these options can be selected at a time.
